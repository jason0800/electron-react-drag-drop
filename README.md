- A simple 2D, tree-like view of folders and files - drag and drop a folder (the starting directory).
- You can zoom in and out, add / delete nodes, move nodes to other “branches”.
- Add metadata in addition to file/folder names (e.g., short description of what goes in a folder - can be AI generated).
- CRUD actions affect native files.
- Intuitive, dumb simple, soft UI (not harsh).
- Electron, React flow, d3, Node.js
- Use AI for assistance
